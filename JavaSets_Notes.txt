Another useful Collections interface is the Set. This Set has come concrete implementations,
such as the HashSet and the TreeSet.

Here is an example of using a Set to spot if a name occurs twice in the input:

    Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
    Set<String> set = new HashSet<String>();

    while(in.hasNext())
    {
        String name - in.next();
        if(set.contains(name))
            Systen.out.println(name + " has already occurred!");
        else
            set.add(name);
    }

Sets can be converted to Lists using the constructor of, e.g., an ArrayList.
